        Args:
            account_id (str): The Plaid `account_id` associated with the holding.
            security_id (str): The Plaid `security_id` associated with the holding. Security data is not specific to a user's account; any user who held the same security at the same financial institution at the same time would have identical security data. The `security_id` for the same security will typically be the same across different institutions, but this is not guaranteed. The `security_id` does not typically change, but may change if inherent details of the security change due to a corporate action, for example, in the event of a ticker symbol change or CUSIP change.
            institution_price (float): The last price given by the institution for this security.
            institution_value (float): The value of the holding, as reported by the institution.
            cost_basis (float, none_type): The total cost basis of the holding (e.g., the total amount spent to acquire all assets currently in the holding).
            quantity (float): The total quantity of the asset held, as reported by the financial institution. If the security is an option, `quantity` will reflect the total number of options (typically the number of contracts multiplied by 100), not the number of contracts.
            iso_currency_code (str, none_type): The ISO-4217 currency code of the holding. Always `null` if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-`null`.
            unofficial_currency_code (str, none_type): The unofficial currency code associated with the holding. Always `null` if `iso_currency_code` is non-`null`. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `iso_currency_code`s.
